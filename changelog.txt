------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.10
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed NBT serialization
- Temporarily disabled the capability handlers
    - These were using too much data on the network when looking at large inventories.
    - They will make a return once I can re-implement them in a way that avoids that

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.9
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed server disconnect when receiving large NBT payloads from TileEntities
    - Only caused when a payload was >2mb in size (which is really, really big for a packet, to be honest...)
    - Most notably occurred was when looking at a RefinedStorage Disk Drive on a large network

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.8
------------------------------------------------------

- Fix backwards compat with supporting mods
    - I cherry-picked the wrong change and the modid got lowercased

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.7
------------------------------------------------------

- Pulled all the improvements over from the 1.11 branch
    - Removed some unnecessary reflection at startup
    - Fixed replacing version at build-time. No more 1.8.0.
    - Moved over to a proper proxy system
    - Fixed the in-game config ignoring localization keys
    - Rewrote packet system. See `CHANGES.md` for more information.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.1
------------------------------------------------------

- Renamed jar file to `Hwyla-*.jar`
- Cleaned up some lang files
- Fixed JEI handler in newer beta versions

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.0
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed display stack displaying the wrong meta in the majority of cases
