------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.12
------------------------------------------------------

- Server now makes sure a requested block is loaded before attempting to access it
- Removed some needless data from the data request packets
    - Packet size is now much smaller
- Added TehNut to mcmod.info author list
- Added a short description to the mcmod.info explaining that the user is using Hwyla
- [API] Added nullability annotations to almost the entire API
- [API] Modified some of the javadocs to be somewhat more informative

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.11
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed alternate crop getter always using a meta of 0
    - If you continue to have problems with it, disable it.
- /dumphandlers now includes NBT handlers

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.10
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed NBT serialization
- Temporarily disabled the capability handlers
    - These were using too much data on the network when looking at large inventories.
    - They will make a return once I can re-implement them in a way that avoids that

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.9
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed server disconnect when receiving large NBT payloads from TileEntities
    - Only caused when a payload was >2mb in size (which is really, really big for a packet, to be honest...)
    - Most notably occurred was when looking at a RefinedStorage Disk Drive on a large network

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.8
------------------------------------------------------

- Increased usefulness of WailaExceptionHandler
    - A full stacktrace is now printed to the root instance directory
- Fixed record tooltip
- Rewrote packet system
    - See `CHANGES.md` for more information
- Add an alternative way to get a crop's item

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.6
------------------------------------------------------

- Lowercased modid in mcmod.info. The file will work properly now.
- Moved over to a proper proxy system instead of the possibly buggy side checks.
- In-game config now properly respects localization keys.
- Added a fallback for when blocks return null in `getPickBlock(...)`
    - This is a big no-no in 1.11. If you notice this (trust me, you will), please report it to the author of the mod.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.5
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed some remaining invalid null stack checks

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.4

- Lowercased the modid to "waila" (Was "Waila")
- Removed some unnecessary reflection
- Added a handler to display items in the Llama and Donkey inventories (and any future mobs that use `AbstractChestHorse`) (#29)
